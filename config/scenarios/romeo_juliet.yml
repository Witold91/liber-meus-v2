world_context: |
  Verona, late 16th century. Two noble houses, Montague and Capulet, are trapped in an old blood feud.
  Honor, reputation, and family duty shape every choice. Public violence brings swift civic punishment.
  The world is realistic and historical: no magic, no modern technology, no supernatural intervention.
  The perspective shifts between protagonists as the tragedy unfolds.
narrator_style: |
  Keep the tone tragic, immediate, and vivid. Use clear modern prose with occasional Shakespearean flavor.

    intro: |
      In a sycamore grove outside Verona's walls, Romeo Montague sits apart from the world — heartsick over Rosaline, a Capulet beauty who has given him nothing but cold silence and polished indifference.
      He has barely registered the morning's street brawl, which rattled the city and brought the Prince himself to the square with another ultimatum for both houses.
      By nightfall, Verona transforms: Capulet Hall opens its doors for a masked feast, and by chance — a servant with an unreadable guest list, a name overheard — Romeo learns that Rosaline will be among the guests.
      He goes to forget her by seeing her, and walks directly into enemy territory where one glance across a crowded hall can ignite something that will outlast both of them.
      Current situation: You are Romeo Montague, alone in a sycamore grove east of the city, nursing an unrequited love while Verona moves without you.

    title: "Act II - Balcony and Vows"
    intro: |
      The feast is over and Verona has gone quiet, but you could not leave.
      You crossed back into enemy territory on instinct — scaling walls you have no right to cross, drawn by a name you should not have learned and a face you cannot stop seeing.
      She is above you on the balcony, her voice drifting down through the dark, unguarded in a way that no Capulet ever is in daylight.
      The Nurse runs messages. In Friar Laurence's cell, love can be made lawful in secret. But every minute you stay in this orchard is a minute a Capulet blade could find you.
      Current situation: You are Romeo Montague, standing in the Capulet orchard beneath Juliet's balcony. The night is warm. Discovery means death.

    intro: |
      Verona at noon is hot, crowded, and brittle; one taunt can turn a street into a battlefield.
      Tybalt demands honor, Mercutio answers with mockery, and Benvolio can already see the shape of coming grief.
      Romeo now stands between sworn friendship and secret marriage, trying to keep peace in a city that rewards retaliation.
      Once blood is spilled, judgment will be swift: the Prince's sentence can separate lovers faster than any wall.
      Current situation: You are in the Dueling Square with Mercutio, Tybalt, and Benvolio present, and the crowd is seconds away from violence.

    intro: |
      The night Romeo left, something in you resolved. You are no longer the sheltered girl who blushed at a stranger across a banquet hall — you are a married woman whose husband is an exile and whose family does not know it.
      Your father has set a date: Paris will have your hand within three days. Your mother nods and urges. The Nurse — who has known you since birth — has begun to counsel forgetting Romeo entirely.
      Everyone in Verona is telling you what to do. Only the Friar knows the truth, and only he might have a way out.
      Current situation: You are Juliet Capulet, alone in your chamber, with three days before a wedding you cannot allow to happen.

    intro: |
      In Mantua, Romeo receives news before he receives truth: Juliet is said to be dead, and time collapses into one desperate decision.
      The friar's letter is delayed, the warning arrives too late, and an apothecary's poison becomes cheaper than patience.
      At the Capulet crypt, grief, misunderstanding, and haste converge in the final darkness of the play.
      Dawn will bring the Prince, both houses, and the last accounting of love, blame, and peace bought at terrible cost.
      Current situation: You are on Mantua Street with Balthasar and an impoverished Apothecary nearby, deciding whether to trust rumor or wait for proof.
