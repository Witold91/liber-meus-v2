    intro: |
      Verona wakes in violence and pride, with Capulet and Montague servants ready to spill blood over old insults no one remembers clearly anymore.
      The Prince has warned both houses before, but rage moves faster than law, and every public clash tightens the noose around both families.
      By night, the city turns from brawl to celebration as Capulet Hall opens for a masked feast filled with politics, flirtation, and dangerous curiosity.
      You are Romeo Montague: restless, impulsive, and walking directly into enemy territory where one meeting can ignite love and ruin in the same breath.
      Current situation: You are in Verona Square with Mercutio and Benvolio nearby as servants from both houses trade provocations.

    title: "Act II - Balcony and Vows"
    intro: |
      The feast is over, but the most important words have not yet been spoken.
      Beneath Juliet's balcony, desire must fight fear: family names, spying servants, and the certainty that discovery means disaster.
      The Nurse runs messages, the night shortens, and every delay raises the chance that rumor outruns truth.
      In Friar Laurence's cell, love can be made lawful in secret, but secrecy itself becomes a fuse that will burn through every later act.
      Current situation: You are in the Capulet Orchard beneath Juliet's balcony, with Juliet and her Nurse close enough that one wrong move can expose you.

    title: "Act III - Duel and Banishment"
    intro: |
      Verona at noon is hot, crowded, and brittle; one taunt can turn a street into a battlefield.
      Tybalt demands honor, Mercutio answers with mockery, and Benvolio can already see the shape of coming grief.
      Romeo now stands between sworn friendship and secret marriage, trying to keep peace in a city that rewards retaliation.
      Once blood is spilled, judgment will be swift: the Prince's sentence can separate lovers faster than any wall.
      Current situation: You are in the Dueling Square with Mercutio, Tybalt, and Benvolio present, and the crowd is seconds away from violence.

    title: "Act IV - The Sleeping Draught"
    intro: |
      Exile has torn Romeo from Verona, and in his absence the Capulets force Juliet toward a marriage with Paris.
      At home, obedience is demanded; in private, panic grows as every adult voice closes another door.
      Juliet seeks Friar Laurence not for comfort but for a plan that can outwit family power, church timing, and public ceremony.
      One vial now carries impossible hope: to appear dead long enough to escape a living prison.
      Current situation: You are in Juliet's Chamber, where Juliet, the Nurse, Paris, and the Capulets are pressing competing demands on every moment.

    title: "Act V - Tomb and Reckoning"
    intro: |
      In Mantua, Romeo receives news before he receives truth: Juliet is said to be dead, and time collapses into one desperate decision.
      The friar's letter is delayed, the warning arrives too late, and an apothecary's poison becomes cheaper than patience.
      At the Capulet crypt, grief, misunderstanding, and haste converge in the final darkness of the play.
      Dawn will bring the Prince, both houses, and the last accounting of love, blame, and peace bought at terrible cost.
      Current situation: You are on Mantua Street with Balthasar and an impoverished Apothecary nearby, deciding whether to trust rumor or wait for proof.
