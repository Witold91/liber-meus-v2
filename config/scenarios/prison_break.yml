title: "Prison Break"
description: "You must escape from a high-security prison before dawn."
turn_limit: 20
world_context: |
  A high-security modern prison, present day. The world is realistic — no magic, no unusual technology. The hero is a prisoner in standard prison-issue clothing. They own nothing except what they find or create during the escape. There are no bags, pockets full of gear, or personal belongings unless explicitly acquired through play.
narrator_style: |
  Write in a terse, urgent style. Sentences are short and punchy. Favour concrete sensory detail over atmosphere — the scrape of metal, the smell of sweat, the sound of boots. Paragraphs should be brief. Avoid flowery language. The tone is grim, tense, and immediate. 20-50 words.

    title: "The Cell Block"
    intro: |
      The fluorescent lights flicker overhead as the midnight count concludes.
      Guard Rodriguez makes his final round, boots echoing on the concrete floor.
      You have three hours until dawn—and your one shot at freedom.
      The cell door is locked but you notice the ventilation grate above your bunk looks loose.
